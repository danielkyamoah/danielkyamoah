Hi there, I'm Daniel Kofi Yamoah! 👋

About Me 🚀

I’m an operations professional in the sports entertainment and customer service industries, where I’ve progressed from a customer service associate to a supervisory role and am preparing for an assistant management position. My day-to-day has sharpened my skills in accuracy, accountability, and people management.

Outside of my main role, I’m building a strong foundation in web development. I’ve mastered HTML and the basics of CSS, and I’m steadily working toward advanced layouts and eventually JavaScript. I enjoy problem-solving, questioning how systems work, and finding smarter ways to get things done.

🌱 Currently learning: CSS layouts (Grid & Flexbox), JavaScript (soon)

🔭 Working on: small projects & forms to strengthen my web dev foundation

🌍 Languages: English (fluent), Akan (native)

⚡ Fun fact: I embraced a shaved head after hair loss — owning it fully.







My Skills 🧠
(JavaScript, React, Node.js will come as you grow — for now, we’ll keep it real with what you’ve mastered)

Featured Projects 💻
Beginner Web Projects

Quick Form Project — A clean and functional HTML/CSS form to practice structure and styling.
Layout Experiments — Practicing CSS Grid and Flexbox using pixel-based layouts for clarity.
(More to come as I expand into JavaScript.)
